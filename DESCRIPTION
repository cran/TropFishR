    analysis of length-frequency data in the context of data-poor
    fisheries. Includes methods and examples included in the FAO
    Manual by P. Sparre and S.C. Venema (1998), "Introduction to tropical fish
    stock assessment" (<https://openknowledge.fao.org/server/api/core/bitstreams/bc7c37b6-30df-49c0-b5b4-8367a872c97e/content>),
