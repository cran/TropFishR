\arguments{
\item{param}{a list consisting of following parameters:

  (length-frequency data) or ages (age composition data),

  \item \code{t0}: theoretical time zero, at which individuals of this species hatch,

  \item \code{b}: length-weight relationship coefficent (W = a * L^b),
  \item \code{catch}: catch as vector for pseudo cohort analysis,
     or a matrix with catches of subsequent years to follow a real cohort.

     for length-based VPA/CA catch can also be provided in weight, e.g. kg (use
     argument \code{catch_unit}).
}}

\item{catch_columns}{numerical; indicating the column of the catch matrix which should be
used for the analysis.}

\item{catch_unit}{optional; a character indicating if the catch is provided in weight
("tons" or "kg") or in thousand individuals ("'000")}

\item{catch_corFac}{optional; correction factor for catch, in case provided
catch does spatially or temporarily not reflect catch for fishing ground of
a whole year.}

\item{terminalF}{the fishing mortality rate of the last age/length group.}

\item{terminalE}{the exploitation rate of the last age/length group.}

\item{analysis_type}{determines which type of assessment should be done,
options: "VPA" for age or length-based Virtual Population Analysis, "CA" for age- or length-based
Cohort Analysis. Default is "VPA".}

\item{algorithm}{an Algorithm to use to solve for fishing mortality. The default
setting \code{"new"} uses \code{\link[stats]{optimise}},
while \code{"old"} uses the algorithm described by Sparre and Venema (1998).}

\item{plus_group}{logical; indicating if the last length group is a plus group (default: TRUE).}

\item{plot}{logical; indicating whether a plot should be printed}

\value{

\itemize{
  \item \strong{classes.num}: numeric age classes or length groups (without plus sign),
  \item \strong{catch.cohort}: a vector with the catch values which were used for
  the analysis (exists only if catch was a matrix),
  \item \strong{FM_calc}: a vector with the ifshing mortality (M),
  \item \strong{Z}: a vector with the total mortality (Z),
  \item \strong{survivors}: a vector with the number of fish surviving to the
      next age class or length group (same unit than input catch vector),

  and catches for plotting;

\description{
This function applies the Virtual Population Analysis (VPA) or
   Cohort analysis (CA). Methods used to estimate stock biomass and fishing
   mortality per age/length group.
}
\details{
The main difference between virtual population analysis (VPA) and cohort
   analysis (CA) is the step of calculating the fishing mortality per age class or
   length group. While CA works with an approximation by assuming that all fish are
   caught during a single day, which makes the calcualtion easier, VPA assumes that
   the fish are caught continuously, which has to be solved by the trial and error
   method (Sparre and Venema, 1998).
   For the age-based VPA/CA the catch has to be provided in numbers (or '000 numbers),
   while for the length-based VPA/CA the catch can also be provided in weight (tons or kg) by
   using the argument \code{catch_unit}.
   The catch has to be representative for fished species, that means there should not be
   other fisheries fishing the same stock. If this is the case \code{catch_corFac} can
   be used as a raising factor to account for the proportion of fish caught by other
   fisheries.
   When the model should follow a real cohort instead of a pseudo cohort, \code{catch}
   has to be provided as matrix. The model then starts to follow the first age class
   in the first column.
   If \code{catch} matrix is shorter than the number of age classes, the age or length
   classes without catch information are omitted. It is recommended to only
   follow a real cohort if there is enough information for all age classes
   (test with: \code{dim(catch)[1] <= dim(catch)[2]}).
   If \code{plus_group} is TRUE a different calculation for the survivors of the last length group
   is used (for more details please refer to Sparre & Venema (1998)).
