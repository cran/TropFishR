\title{Fitting VBGF growth curves through lfq data}
\usage{
lfqFitCurves(lfq, par = list(Linf = 100, K = 0.1, t_anchor = 0.25, C = 0, ts =
  0), agemax = NULL, flagging.out = TRUE, lty = 2, lwd = 1, col = 1,
  draw = FALSE, tincr = 0.05)
}
\arguments{
\item{lfq}{a list of the class "lfq" consisting of following parameters:
\itemize{
  \item \strong{midLengths} midpoints of the length classes,
  \item \strong{dates} dates of sampling times (class Date),
  \item \strong{catch} matrix with catches/counts per length class (row)
     and sampling date (column),
  \item \strong{rcounts} restructured frequencies,
  \item \strong{peaks_mat} matrix with positive peaks with distinct values,
  \item \strong{ASP} available sum of peaks, sum of posititve peaks which
     could be potential be hit by growth curves;
}}

\item{par}{a list with following growth parameters:
 \itemize{
  \item \strong{Linf} length infinity in cm (default: 100),
  \item \strong{K} curving coefficient (default: 0.1),
  \item \strong{t_anchor} time point anchoring growth curves in year-length
  coordinate system, corrsponds to peak spawning month (range: 0 to 1, default: 0.25),
  \item \strong{C} amplitude of growth oscillation (range: 0 to 1, default: 0),
  \item \strong{ts} summer point (ts = WP - 0.5) (range: 0 to 1, default: 0);
}}

\item{agemax}{maximum age of species; default NULL, then estimated from Linf}

\item{flagging.out}{logical; should positive peaks be flagged out?
(Default : TRUE)}

\item{lty}{The line type. Line types can either be specified as an integer
(0=blank, 1=solid, 2=dashed (default), 3=dotted, 4=dotdash, 5=longdash,
6=twodash) or as one of the character strings "blank", "solid", "dashed",
"dotted", "dotdash", "longdash", or "twodash", where "blank" uses 'invisible
lines' (i.e., does not draw them).}

\item{lwd}{The line width, a positive number, defaulting to 2. The interpretation
is device-specific, and some devices do not implement line widths less
than one. (See the help on the device for details of the interpretation.)}

\item{col}{A specification for the default plotting color. See section
'Color Specification'.}

\item{draw}{logical; indicating whether growth curves should be added to
existing lfq plot}

\item{tincr}{step for plotting}
}
\value{
A list with the input parameters and following list objects:
\itemize{
  \item \strong{Lt}: dataframe with ages and lengths of the cohorts,
  \item \strong{agemax}: maximum age of species.
  \item \strong{ncohort}: number of cohorts,
  \item \strong{ASP}: available sum of peaks, sum of posititve peaks which
  could be potential be hit by growth curves. This is calculated as the sum of
  maximum values from each run of posive restructured scores.
  \item \strong{ESP}: available sum of peaks,
  \item \strong{fASP}: available sum of peaks,
  \item \strong{fESP}: available sum of peaks,
}

\description{
Thsi function estimates von Bertalanffy growth function (VBGF)
   curves for a set of growth parameters.
}
\details{
\code{t_anchor} subsitutes the starting point from known from Fisat 2.
   This parameter is necessary for anchoring the growth curves on the time axis.
   It does not subsitute \code{t0}. However, it corresponds to the peak spawning
   of the species (x intercept of growth curve) and has values between 0 and 1,
   where 0 corresponds to spawning at the 1st of January and 0.999 corresponds to the
   31st of December. The default value of 0.25 or 3/12 corresponds the third month
   of the year, March.
