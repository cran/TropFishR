\description{
This function applies Beverton & Holt's yield per recruit model
   as well as the Thompson & Bell model. These models predict catch, yield, biomass
   and economic values for different
   fishing mortality scenarions (in combination with gear changes).
}
\details{
The Thompson and Bell model incorporates an iteration step simulating the
   stock by means
   of the \code{\link{stock_sim}} function. In case changes in gear
   characteristics -
   here measured in terms of Lc or tc, the length or age at first capture,
   respectively -
   should be explored, a list with selectivity information about the gear has
   to be provided and
   the prediction models make use of the selectivity \code{\link{select_ogive}}
   function.
   Sparre and Venema (1998) recommend to treat the last length class always as plus group.
   This model is very sensitive to zero observations in the ultimate length
   classes. If unrealistic results are returned,
   it is recommended to cut length classes with zero observations, group
   them in a plus group or to change the interval between
   length classes.
   Equations which are used in this function assume isometric growth, an
   assumption often not met. Further, the assumption that there is no relationship
   between the parental stock size and progeny
   over a wide range of fishing mortalities or exploitation values,
   respectively, is also said to be untrue. By default, the functions assume
   knife-edge recruitment and selection of gears (Sparre and Venema, 1998).
   If E_change instead of FM_change is used the range is cut at E=0.9, because
   higher values of E correspond to unrealistic high values of fishing mortality.
   If no selectivity information is given (by use of s_list), knife edge selectivity
   with L50 equal to the first argument of Lc_change is assumed.
