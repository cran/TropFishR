  plot = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{param}{a list consisting of following parameters:
\itemize{
  \item \code{midLengths} or \code{age}: midpoints of the length classes (length-frequency
  data) or ages (age composition data),
  \item \code{Linf}: infinite length for investigated species in cm [cm],
  \item \code{K}: growth coefficent for investigated species per year [1/year],
  \item \code{t0}: theoretical time zero, at which individuals of this species hatch,
  \item \code{catch}: catches, vector or matrix with catches of subsequent years if
  the catch curve with constat time intervals should be applied;
}}

\item{catch_columns}{numerical; indicating the column of the catch matrix which should be
used for the analysis.}

\item{cumulative}{logical; if TRUE the cumulative
catch curve is applied (Jones and van Zalinge method)}

\item{calc_ogive}{logical; if TRUE the selection ogive is additionally
calculated from the catch curve (only if \code{cumulative = FALSE})}

\item{reg_int}{instead of using the identity method a range can be determined,
which is to be used for the regression analysis. If equal to NULL identity method
is applied (default). For multiple regression lines provide list with the two points
for the regression line in each element of the list.}

\item{reg_num}{integer indicating how many separate regression lines should be applied to the
data. Default 1.}

\item{auto}{logical; no interactive functions used instead regression line is chosen
automatically. Default = FALSE}

\item{plot}{logical; should a plot be displayed? Default = TRUE}
}
\value{

\itemize{
  \item \strong{classes.num}, \strong{tplusdt_2}, \strong{t_midL}, or
     \strong{ln_Linf_L}: age, relative age or subsitute depending on input and method,

  \item \strong{Sobs}: observed selection ogive,
  \item \strong{ln_1_S_1}: dependent variable of regression analysis for
  selectivity parameters,
  \item \strong{Sest}: estimated selection ogive,
  \item \strong{t50}: age at first capture (age at which fish have a 50%
  probability to be caught),
  \item \strong{t75}: age at which fish have a 75% probability to be caught,
  \item \strong{L50}: length at first capture (length at which fish have a 50%
  probability to be caught),
  \item \strong{L75}: length at which fish have a 75% probability to be caught;

\description{
This function applies the (length-converted) linearised catch
   curve to age composition and length-frequency data,
   respectively. It allows to estimate the instantaneous total mortality rate (Z).
   Optionally, the gear selectivity can be estimated and the cumulative catch
   curve cna be applied.
}
\details{
This function includes the \link{identify} function, which asks you to
  choose two points from a graph manually. The two points which you choose by clicking
  on the plot in the graphical device represent the start and end of the data points,
  which should be used for the analysis. Based on these points the regression line
  is calculated.
  When the selection ogive
  is calculated by means of the catch curve the assumption is made, that Z is constant
  for all year classes or length groups, respectively. Accoring to Sparre and Venema
  (1998) this assumption might be true, because F is smaller for young fish
  (Selectivity) while M is higher for young fish (high natural mortality). The selectivity
  for not fully exploited old fish (e.g. due to gillnet fishery) can not be calculated yet
  by use of the catch curve.
  Based on the format of the list argument \code{catch} and whether the argument
  \code{catch_columns} is defined, the function automatically
  distinguishes between the catch curve with variable parameter system (if catch is a
  vector) and the one with constant parameter system (if catch is a matrix or a
  data.frame and \code{catch_columns = NA}). In the case of the variable parameter
  system the catches of one year are
  assumed to represent the catches during the entire life span of a so called
  pseudo-cohort.
  The cumulative catch curve does not allow for the estimation of the selectivity
  ogive.
